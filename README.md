# 🚀 Codeforces Conquests 🚀

**Welcome to the Battle Arena!** 🏆

This repository is your front-row seat to my gladiatorial combats in the world of competitive programming. Watch as I tackle some of the most devious Codeforces problems with nothing but sheer willpower, a keyboard, and copious amounts of caffeine. ☕️

## 🧠 Problem Solving Arsenal

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various Codeforces problems. Each file is a testament to my problem-solving abilities, logical acrobatics, and occasional bouts of creative swearing. (Don't worry, I kept the code clean—mostly.)

### 🗂️ Structure

- **`/easy-peasy/`**: The "Hello World!" of competitive programming. Consider this the warm-up lap.
- **`/brain-teasers/`**: Where things start to get spicy. These problems require some serious thinking—and maybe a snack break.
- **`/nightmare-mode/`**: Code at your own risk. These are the problems that kept me up at night, questioning my life choices.
- **`/epic-victories/`**: The crème de la crème. These are the solutions I'm most proud of. They may or may not come with a celebratory dance. 💃

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

- **Proof of Skill:** Every solution here is a badge of honor, showing off my problem-solving skills, algorithms knowledge, and ability to stare at a screen for hours on end.
- **Learning & Growth:** This is also my learning journal. Each problem solved is a lesson learned, a new trick up my sleeve, and a step closer to coding enlightenment.
